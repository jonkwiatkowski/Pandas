My submission for Assignment 4.
## Overview
In this project, we will analyze standardized test results from a city's school-district to help the school district and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future budget allocation and priorities. We will create snapshots of key metrics including the following:

* total students
* total budget
* average math/reading scores
* percentage of students who passed math/reading
* percentage of students who passed both. 

We will analyze these metrics from a district wide perspective and school-by-school. We will look at math and reading scores by grade as well as top (and bottom) perfroming schools overall. Finally, we will check to see if there are any trends in scores when related to school spending, school size, or school type.
