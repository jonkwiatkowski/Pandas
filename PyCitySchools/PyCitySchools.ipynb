    "### Analysis\n",
    "* As you'll see in the following analysis, students who attend charter schools as opposed to district schools do significantly better on standardized tests. Not only are the top five performing schools charter schools and the bottom five performing schools district schools, the overall percentage of students who passed both reading and math is almost 40% higher at charter schools than their district counterparts on average.\n",
    "* Another interesting takeaway is that schools who have a smaller per student budget tend to have higher schores. This is evident in the scores by school spending section. As school spending increases, student scores decrease.\n",
    "* A final important takeaway is that although small and medium schools have similar performance, students who attend larger schools perform worse on average with a decreased passing rate 30% less than their smaller counterparts."
